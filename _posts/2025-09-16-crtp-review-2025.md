---

Hello everyone, I'll start by introducing myself. I'm **El Mehdi Dridi**, an ICT student passionate about red teaming, especially AD pentesting. This year I've been practicing on Hack The Box and VulnLab labs. That experience gave me useful hands-on knowledge about Active Directory, and at some point I asked myself:

> "What if I take an AD certification to validate these skills?"

While I was deciding which certification to pursue, our team **no!dea** placed third at the **Cybersphere** — the Tunisian Cybersecurity National Congress. As part of the prize, we won a CRTP voucher, which made the choice clear: I decided to go for the CRTP exam.

## What is CRTP?

**CRTP (Certified Red Team Professional)** is a hands-on certification focused on AD penetration testing and red team tactics. The course provides a real-life AD infrastructure — a great enterprise environment to practice attacks and defenses, which I really liked because it feels like real-world pentesting.

## Course and Labs

The CRTP package includes:

- Course videos
- 30 days of lab access
- 24 hours exam
- 48 hours to submit the report

The course is excellent. It explains each topic — enumeration, attack vectors, exploitation — in detail. What stood out to me is that it doesn't just teach you commands; it also dives into **what happens behind the scenes** during attacks, often illustrated with diagrams and real-life examples. Being able to practice immediately in a realistic enterprise environment adds immense value.

## Detection, Mitigation, and Opsec

The course also covers **stealthy operation techniques** to avoid detection by EDR/MDR solutions, and includes mitigation and hardening recommendations. That defensive side is useful for understanding both attack and remediation.

## Prerequisites

While CRTP is beginner-friendly in structure, you should ideally have:

- A solid understanding of Windows fundamentals
- Basic to intermediate PowerShell knowledge
- Familiarity with tools like BloodHound, Mimikatz, and PowerView

## Comparison with HTB & VulnLab

Hack The Box and VulnLab (now merged) are excellent AD training platforms. Personally, I strongly recommend HTB labs, especially after the partnership with VulnLab — they offer a huge variety of AD challenges and are one of the best resources to prepare.

The main difference is that **CRTP provides RDP (GUI) access** to the lab hosts, while HTB labs are accessed remotely over VPN from your local host. Both approaches are valuable: RDP makes some workflows easier, while VPN access mirrors real-world remote exploitation.

## Exam Day & Report

On exam day I faced a realistic scenario and had to submit a detailed professional report. The lab connection was stable, and the support team usually fixed problems quickly (within about 5 minutes). I completed the technical part of the exam in about **7 hours** out of the 24 allowed.

The toughest part for me was the report — it took around **14 hours** to write because it had to be very detailed. I believe the report is what truly gives CRTP its professional impact, since it reflects how a real red team engagement is delivered to a client.

After submission, the staff contacted me within 5 days to confirm that I had successfully obtained the certification, and on the 6th day they sent me the official certificate.

## Final Thoughts

**CRTP is a very professional, practical certification** that proves real AD pentesting skills. I recommend it for anyone who already has Windows/AD basics and wants hands-on red team experience. Alongside that, I also recommend practicing on HTB (especially now with VulnLab) as a perfect complement for your preparation.

Finally, I want to thank the **AlteredSecurity** staff for their support, and especially **Mr. Nikhil Mittal** for designing such a high-quality course and lab environment.
